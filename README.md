# Decision Tree Classifier

This machine learning project utilizes Decision Trees for digit classification. The dataset consists of digits, and the model is trained to predict the correct digit based on various features.

Special thanks to Ali Ahmed, Ahmed Ayman, and Mostafa Ahmed for their valuable contributions and assistance in this project.

## 🚀 Dataset Information:
The dataset is loaded from the sklearn library, and it contains information about digits, including pixel values.

## ⚙️ Model Training:
A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the dataset using a 70-30 train-test split. The model's accuracy and confusion matrix are then evaluated.

## 💰 Results:
Accuracy: 0.7965023847376789

## ⚡ Technologies Used:
Python
